What has been submitted?
A IP address to our Spring application hosted on an orcale server. We are currently working on getting a domain name for it as well, but the IP works fine for now.

What is on the Oracle Server?
A working spring application, which serves a minimal HTML front end. The spring application is connected to an oracle MySQL DB correctly, however we did not have time to implement data manipulation or dispay from the DB.

What is currently being worked on?
Full database integration so that we can add and delete bookings from the front end.

What do we need from you if possible?
IT services denied our request for them to allow us to use Single-Sign on for the project. This is pretty integral to our client's requirements, so we were wondering if you could have a word with IT services?
