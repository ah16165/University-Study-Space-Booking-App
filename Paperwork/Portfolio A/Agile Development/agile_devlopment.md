<h3> Agile Development Process</h3>

<p>Throughout the project we tried to follow the mantra of employing as many agile development techniques as possible. These are listed as a short summary below:</p>

*We employed pair programming for the majority of the coding process, which allowed a really productive workflow. This allowed a second pair of eyes over the code and for good insights, as well as two or three brains to come up with ideas as opposed to one.

*Initially, we deployed the product to the client whenever a major change had been introduced. In the latter half of the project we changed this approach to a continuous integration and approach using Circle CI, so that the client always had access to the most up to date version. We also iterativley delivered to the user.

*We had regular face to face meetings with our client.

*Whenever the code structure, or indeed the openproject page, became too disorganised we cleared it up to be neat and readable.

*We embraced change even late into the project. An example of this was when we had a client focus group with the finished product and they request a few changes, which we happily implemented.

*We happily changed the project structure throughout if it needed to be changed rather than trying to create a Frankenstein from clashing frameworks or structures.

*Everyone was responsible for all the code.

*We used Slack to communicate in a dedicated work channel.

*We supplied the client with user, admin and sys admin manuals.

*Close cooperation with the client.

*Regularily changed team roles.
