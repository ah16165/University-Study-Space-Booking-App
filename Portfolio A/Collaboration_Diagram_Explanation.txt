The collaboration diagram aims to show how objects interact with each other through methods, and to define some sort of system flow through a critical part of the system. Here we are modelling the flow of a user object being created, and being used to create booking objects that then deal with the actual process of managing bookings in the SQL database via several methods.

There are three potential paths that could be taken once the user object has been created; make a new booking, edit an exiting booking or delete a booking. 

Make a new booking:

1. user.create_booking() is called to create a new booking object. This is filled with the user defined parametres, sourced from an input form on the front end. These input parametres become the attributes of the booking object.
2. booking.make_booking() is called, with its input parametres being the attributes of the object. This method queries the database to add a new booking entry into it. 
3. booking.send_email() is called which sends a confirmation email to the user's email address.
4. The booking object nullifies itself.

Edit a Booking:

1. user.edit_booking() is called to create a new booking object. The input parametres are given by a user selection. These input parametres become the attributes of the booking object.
2. booking.edit_booking() is called, with its input parametres being the attributes of the object. This method queries the database to update an entry. 
3. booking.send_email() is called which sends a confirmation email to the user's email address.
4. The booking object nullifies itself.

Delete a booking:

1. user.delete_booking() is called, with input given by the user. This queries the database and deletes the corresponding entry.
