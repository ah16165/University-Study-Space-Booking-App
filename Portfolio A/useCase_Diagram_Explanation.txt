The Use Case Diagram is a dynamic UML model aimed to show the relationships between actors and use cases within a system.
In this case the primary actors; those being Student and Admin, can call on the system for each of their use case, with secondary actors; being Single Sign-On or the Server responding to the request and the system being the Study Space Booking App.

The centre System rectangle contains only use cases, where Log in, Make a booking, View room information, View booking, Edit a booking and Delete a booking are all use cases from the primary actors. Verify log in and Send confirmation email are secondary use cases to react to the primary use cases used for the secondary actors.

The Log in use case is the first use case called from either of the primary actors as it will be required to perform any of the other use cases.
Verify log in is included as itâ€™s a necessary use case for Single Sign-On to perform Log in.

Make a booking and View bookings don't follow an order and either can be called from either primary actors.
View room information is extended from Make a booking so room information can be checked before booking.
Edit a booking is extended from View bookings, Delete a booking is extended from Edit a booking. So to Edit a booking, a primary actor has to View bookings then Edit a booking.
To Delete a booking, a primary actor has to View bookings, then Edit a booking and then Delete a booking.

Send comfirmation email is a use case for Server which is used every time a request to Make a booking, Edit a booking or Delete a booking is made.
